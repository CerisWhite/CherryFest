# CherryFest
A splatfest downloader for traditional Wii U homebrew environments


Building is simple. Install devkitPPC and `libcurl`, then run `make` in the root directory. Once built, just copy `cherryfest.rpx` to `sd:/wiiu/apps/<folder>/` and run like any other app.

To make it download *your* files, replace the URLs on lines 94, 95, and 96 with your own.

The version of `iosuhax` provided is from years ago and I no longer remember the origin. It is most likely dimok's original release.
